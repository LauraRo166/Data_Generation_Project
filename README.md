# Medical Data Generator

This project is a **synthetic data generator** designed for academic and research purposes, particularly in the context of **medical records simulation**. It creates structured, pseudorandom datasets that resemble real-world patient consultation records. The generator supports a variable number of rows and produces data with realistic constraints and distributions.

## âœ¨ Features

- Generates CSV datasets with realistic structure and content.
- Includes personal data like:
  - Full name
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Height (according to average by gender in Colombia)
  - Weight
  - Symptoms
  - Diagnoses
  - Observations
- Each row includes a unique identifier (UUID).
- Supports a configurable number of records.
- Ensures logical consistency (e.g., symptoms match possible diagnoses).
- Generates column headers and synthetic values formatted as in real medical intake forms.
- Written in Python and fully tested with over **90% code coverage**.

  
## ðŸ§ª Testing & Coverage

This project uses `unittest` for testing. Coverage reports are generated using `coverage.py`.

```bash
coverage run --omit="tests/*" -m unittest discover -s tests
coverage report
```

## ðŸ“Š Real data used
This section presents the real data used to generate the synthetic data generated by the tool. In some cases the information was used based on that registered in Colombia.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Comparison

This section presents real-world data from Colombia, which was used as a benchmark to validate the synthetic data generated by the project. The goal is to ensure that the generated data realistically reflects known demographic and health statistics.

### 1. **Blood Type Distribution in Colombia**

The distribution of blood types in the Colombian population follows expected epidemiological trends, with type O+ being the most common, followed by A+. This information is essential for generating synthetic health data that respects biological population patterns.

| Blood Type | Real % (DANE/INS) |
|------------|-------------------|
| O+         | 56%               |
| A+         | 26%               |
| B+         | 7%               |
| AB+        | 2%                |
| Oâˆ’         | 5%                |
| Aâˆ’         | 3%                |
| Bâˆ’         | 0.7%              |
| ABâˆ’        | 0.3%              |

### 2. **Average Height in Colombia**

Height averages differ by gender, with men averaging about 170.6 cm and women about 158.6 cm. These values were used to calibrate the synthetic data for the height variable to maintain realism based on national statistics.

| Gender | Real Avg Height (cm) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Male   | 171.9                |
| Female | 158                  |

### 3. **Average Weight by Age in Colombia**

Weight varies across age groups, reflecting changes in metabolism and lifestyle. These averages were used to generate age-appropriate synthetic weight data consistent with observed trends in Colombia.

| Age Range | Real Avg Weight (kg) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 0â€“18      | 40.5                 |
| 19â€“40     | 67.5                 |
| 41â€“65     | 70.2                 |
| 66+       | 65.4                 |

### 4. **Smoker Rate by Gender in Colombia**

Smoking prevalence differs between genders, with higher rates among men. This data was integrated to model behavioral variables like smoking status realistically within the synthetic dataset.

| Gender | Real % Smokers (ENS 2020) |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Male   | 16.9%                      |
| Female | 7.6%                       |

### 5. **Smoker Rate by Age in Colombia**

Smoking rates also vary significantly with age, peaking in young adults and decreasing in older populations. This stratification was used to generate age-specific smoking habits.

| Age Range | Real % Smokers |
|-----------|----------------|
| 12â€“24     | 18.6%           |
| 25â€“44     | 13.2%          |
| 45â€“64     | 11.7%          |
| 65+       | 6.2%           |

### 6. **Alcohol Consumption in Colombia**

Alcohol consumption shows gender differences, with a higher percentage of men reporting recent alcohol use. This behavioral factor was considered for realistic lifestyle data generation.

| Gender | Real % Consumers (ENS 2020) |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| Male   | 58.1%%                       |
| Female | 41.9%                       |

### 7. **Heart Rate by Age (Resting bpm)**

Average resting heart rates typically decline slightly with age. These norms informed the simulation of vital signs within the synthetic dataset.

| Age Range | Normal Range (bpm) | Real Avg (bpm) |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0â€“18      | 70â€“100             | 85             |
| 19â€“40     | 60â€“100             | 76             |
| 41â€“65     | 60â€“100             | 75             |
| 66+       | 60â€“100             | 73             |

### 8. **Respiratory Rate by Age (Breaths per Minute)**

Respiratory rates remain relatively stable across ages but slightly vary in children versus adults. This was reflected in the generated synthetic vital signs.

| Age Range | Normal Range | Real Avg |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 0â€“18      | 16â€“22        | 18       |
| 19â€“40     | 12â€“20        | 16       |
| 41â€“65     | 12â€“20        | 16       |
| 66+       | 12â€“20        | 17       |

### 9. **Systolic Blood Pressure by Age (mm Hg)**

Systolic blood pressure tends to increase with age due to vascular changes. These figures were used to guide realistic generation of blood pressure values within the dataset.

| Age Range | Normal Range | Real Avg |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 0â€“18      | 90â€“120       | 110      |
| 19â€“40     | 110â€“130      | 120      |
| 41â€“65     | 115â€“140      | 130      |
| 66+       | 120â€“150      | 138      |
